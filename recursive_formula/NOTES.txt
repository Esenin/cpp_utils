Compiler:
	In purpose to use C++14 features I compile using gcc-6. It seems that clang-3.6 with -std=c++1y  works OK too.

Run:
	for both of the exercises I provide build.sh script. It uses cmake to build target and then it runs the tests. You'll see the output

Tests:
	STL asserts are used in tests. Notice: NDEBUG macros was switched off in the moment of including assert.h

Notes for Exercise 2:
--------------------

Hashmap buckets are based on linked-list approach.
Collision resolution is simple chaining.

There are read-write mutexes within each bucket (read-write mutexes for each linked-list node may cause too much overhead). 
It allows multiple readers to lookup. While many threads are able to insert/remove simultaneously in different buckets, only one can do it for single bucket.


Table resizing:
hashtable is capable to increase it's number of buckets in incremental way. 
There are global exclusive lock in the map in order to switch it's internal state only (switch primary/secondary tables, etc.). 
On each insert/remove call within 'resizing' state the map moves some amount of elements from the old table to the new one. 
The map uses atomic counters to track size of the tables.

====================
This is second version of these source code. The main reason for this is for my moving from QtCreator to Clion IDE. First time I didn't notice that Clion doesn't turn on -Wall warnings by default, so there are pretty much of them in my first version. Shame of me. I fixed it :-)
